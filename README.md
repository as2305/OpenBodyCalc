# OpenBodyCalc

OpenBodyCalc is a body metric calculator built using Python. It uses CustomTkinter for GUI. It can calculate the following:


1. **Body Mass Index (BMI)**: BMI is determined by dividing a person's weight in kilograms twice by their height in meters. 

2. **Maximum Heart Rate (HRMax)**: HRMax is an estimate of the maximum heart rate a person can achieve during physical activity. 

3. **Maximum Oxygen Consumption (VO2Max)**: VO2Max represents the maximum amount of oxygen a person can utilize during intense exercise. It is calculated using the Cooper Test. It requires input of maximum distance run in 12 minutes in kilometers.

4. **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR)**: The basal metabolic rate (BMR) is the amount of energy needed while resting in a temperate environment when the digestive system is inactive.
